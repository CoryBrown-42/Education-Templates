RPG (leveling up)

RTS (clicking to select a building, clicking a button that pops up to recruit a unit)

Game Design Discussion Helper Game:

  Goal: Make a game which can demonstrate and provoke discussion of the important topics of player feedback ('juicy' feedback) and providing them info, balance and difficulty, and guiding the player.

  Format: A simple example adventure/rpg game where the player needs to find something, fight some enemies, jump over platforms, and beat a boss.

    But, with 2 different versions of the level:

--In one, there are no indicators or hints, no health bars, no sound when you hit something, etc. The standard enemies provide no feedback when you hit them, the platforms require near pixel-perfect jumping, and the boss fires so fast that he's impossible to beat.  The level should be designed so its easy to get lost without help. The player gets no instructions.

--In the other version of the same level, you have a health bar, lights and particles guide the player to the thing they need to find, the enemies make a sound when you hit them and a particle effect, and health bars indicate how much hp they have. The boss is more balanced, the platforms are easier to cross. The player is given instructions.
